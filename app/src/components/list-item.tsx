/**
 * One row of a list: something at the start, a title with a line under it, small facts and
 * buttons at the far end, and optionally the whole middle pressable. One source for both
 * platforms.
 *
 * It is here because six web apps and five Expo apps wrote this row by hand — philotes'
 * `PersonRow`, telos' `TodoRow`, min-agent's settings rows, mcp-router's `ServerRow` — and
 * `@cubeui/item`, the shadcn primitive that covers it on the web, has no React Native half. The
 * copies agree on the shape (`gap-3`, `px-3 py-2.5`, a `text-sm font-medium` title over an
 * `text-xs` muted line) and disagree on the part that matters: where the press goes.
 *
 * **The pressed area is the middle, and only the middle.** A row that opens *and* has buttons is
 * the common case, and the hand-written answer was either a button wrapping buttons (invalid
 * HTML, and every inner click also opens the row) or a stretched overlay whose inner controls
 * need `pointer-events` juggling on two platforms. So the row is three siblings — `leading`, the
 * pressable middle, `action` — and each control is reached, pressed and announced on its own.
 * On the web the middle is a real `<button>`, named by the text inside it.
 *
 * No surface: a row lives in a list, a card or a section, and that owns the border. Pass
 * `className="rounded-lg border border-border bg-card"` for the telos look.

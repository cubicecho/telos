 * One row of a sidebar: a link with an optional icon, a label that truncates, an optional

 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Link href={`/projects/${id}`} asChild>
 *   <SidebarNavItem label={name} active={id === current} />
 * </Link>
 *
 * const SidebarLink = createLink(SidebarNavItem); // TanStack Router
 * <SidebarLink to="/" label="Documents" active={isCurrent} />

 *
 * `Link asChild` clones its child with the `href` and the press handler, and `createLink` renders
 * it with both; this forwards the ref and every prop it does not name to the `Pressable`, which is
 * what lets them land. So neither passes `href` to the row — the router's is the one destination,
 * and the row is a real `<a href>` all the same. A router that hands out only a click handler —
 * react-router's `useLinkClickHandler` — passes it as `onClick` beside the row's own `href`.
 *
 * `role="link"` is what makes it a link on both platforms: TalkBack and VoiceOver say "link", and
 * the compiler emits an `<a>`. The current page is said twice, for the same reason `segmented`
 * says its pill twice — `accessibilityState` on device, `aria-current="page"` on the web, which is
 * the one spelling a web screen reader reads and the one react-native-web would have dropped.
 *
 * **With `onPress` and no `href` it is a button** — `onClick` on the web, and no `active`.
 * That is the footer's Sign out: drawn like the Settings row above it, but it does something
 * rather than going somewhere, so it is `role="button"` on device and a `<button type="button">`
 * on the web, and never carries `aria-current`. What decides the element is the `href` the row
 * *renders* with, so a router's row is a link however it was written; a row written with neither
 * and no router around it has nowhere to go and nothing to do, and is drawn as an inert button.
 *

/**
 * A whole page: its title block pinned above a body that scrolls under it.
 *
 * This is `StickyHeaderContentFooter` with a `PageHeader` in its header slot, and it exists
 * because that is the sentence two apps here wrote out for themselves rather than the component
 * they reached for. `kanban_server/web/components/app-shell.tsx:282` and
 * `task_server/web/components/app-shell.tsx:46` are the same forty lines twice — the same
 * `title`, `description`, `actions`, the same `min-h-0 flex-1 overflow-y-auto`, the same
 * centred column — and having written it twice they disagree on the only prop that varies:
 * `wide` means `max-w-5xl` in one and `max-w-none` in the other, over a `max-w-3xl` default that
 * neither of them named. Across these projects there are 51 capped page columns in 10 widths.
 *
 * So the contribution is not the composition, which is four lines. It is that `width` is a word
 * — `page`, `prose`, `full` — instead of a number the next page picks again.
 *
 * **What it does not do.** It does not own the sidebar, the theme toggle or the route: those
 * belong to an app shell, and shadcn ships `sidebar` for the drawing. It does not scroll the
 * header away with the rows — that is the whole point of the chassis under it. And it takes no
 * `children`; the page is `content`, like every other slot in this set.

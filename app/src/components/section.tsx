/**
 * A heading over a group of fields or rows — one source for both platforms.
 *
 * It is here because three projects wrote it separately and got *almost* the same: `text-xs
 * font-semibold uppercase` and a muted foreground in all three, then `tracking-wider` in one and
 * `tracking-wide` in another, and a `border-b pb-1` in the third. Nobody copied anybody — they each
 * typed the same five tokens from memory, which is why the sixth is different. The fourth copy was
 * a React Native one, which is why this is no longer a web-only item.
 *
 * The surface is a prop, not a wrapper. Some apps put every section on a card and some put none
 * on one, and the version that said "wrap it yourself" is the one that got rewritten locally with
 * the card inside, the title in a card header, and a `role="region"` that nobody else had.
 *
 * The semantics, both platforms:
 *
 * - The title is a heading of rank `level`. On device that is `role="heading"`, which VoiceOver and
 *   TalkBack both navigate by. On the web it is `role="heading"` + `aria-level` on the title's
 *   `<span>` rather than an `<h2>`: the rank is a prop, and the compiler writes the tag once, so a
 *   rank known only at runtime keeps its ARIA — which is the same heading to assistive technology.
 * - The root is a `<section>` on the web (`webAs`), named by its title through `aria-labelledby`,
 *   which is what makes it a `region` landmark. An untitled section has no name and so is not a
 *   landmark, which is correct: a landmark nobody can name is noise in the landmark list.
 *
 * No state, no data, no `children` — the body is `content`, like every other shell here.

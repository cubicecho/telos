/**
 * One row in a list of things you can open: a run, a task, an archived record. One source for
 * both platforms.
 *
 * The row itself is `Item`, so a row that opens and a row that does not line up down to the
 * padding. What this adds is `Disclosure`'s opening, and it is here rather than left to each app
 * because the parts of a disclosure that go wrong are the small ones:
 *
 * - **The whole heading is one button** — a `<button>` on the web, `role="button"` on device —
 *   so the row is reached by Tab and works with Space, not a chevron with a press handler, which
 *   is the version hand-written rows ship.
 * - `aria-expanded` on that button, so the state is announced rather than only drawn as a
 *   rotated chevron; and on the web `aria-controls` naming the body, while the body is there.
 * - The chevron turns off the same boolean, so there is one source of truth for open.
 * - **`action` sits outside the button.** A control nested inside a button is invalid HTML and,
 *   in practice, a delete button that cannot be pressed. Three pages of one app were laid out
 *   this way after finding that out.
 *
 * It is not a prop on `Item`: an `open`/`onOpenChange` pair there would turn every existing
 * caller's heading into a button, which is a different element and a different contract. And it
 * is not `Disclosure` itself, whose look is a section's compact muted line; this is a list row,
 * bordered, with badges and a line of facts beside the title.
 *
 * Open is controlled, because in these apps a row is often opened from somewhere else — a deep
 * link to a run, a "show the failure" button further up the page. An uncontrolled default would
 * be a convenience worth adding, not the base case.
 *
 * On a device, a string `meta`, `action` or `content` is wrapped in a `Text` by the `Item` part it
 * sits in; an element is placed as it is.

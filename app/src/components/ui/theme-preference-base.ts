 * `dark` goes on `<html>` for Dark, and for System while the device is dark; `light` goes on it for
 * Light only. `dist/tokens.native.css` (Expo web) reads both over its `prefers-color-scheme` block;
 * `tokens.web.css` (the DOM registry) has no media query and reads `.dark` alone, which is why
 * System still sets `dark` on a dark device rather than leaving it to a query that stylesheet does
 * not have.

 * browser with storage switched off throws on `localStorage` itself.

/**
 * A titled part of a screen whose body shows and hides — "Show completed (3)" under a list, "Raw
 * output" over a payload nobody reads in passing. One source for both platforms.
 *
 * It is here because fourteen places in eight projects wrote it by hand, three ways: a chevron
 * `<button>` with a rotate class (mcp-router, three times), a bare `<details>` (task_server,
 * kanban, zeromem), and a ghost `Button` whose label flips between Show and Hide (telos, auto-cal,
 * min-agent on device). `<details>` has no React Native counterpart, so the native copies each
 * rebuilt it from `useState`, and none of the three shapes agreed on where an action goes.
 *
 * What it guarantees is `DisclosureRow`'s list, because they are the parts hand-written
 * disclosures get wrong:
 *
 * - **The whole header is one button** — a `<button>` on the web, `role="button"` on device —
 *   so it is reached by Tab and toggled by Enter and Space, not a 16-pixel chevron with a handler.
 * - `aria-expanded` on that button, so the state is announced rather than only drawn; and on the
 *   web `aria-controls` naming the body, while the body is there to name.
 * - The chevron turns off the same boolean, so there is one source of truth for open.
 * - **`action` sits outside the button.** A button in a button is invalid, and the nested one's
 *   click toggles the section on its way up.
 *
 * The look is the compact one, since that is what most of the copies are: a muted `text-sm`
 * line with the chevron before it, and the body under it with no inset. `titleClassName` is how a
 * caller makes the title the foreground where the disclosure is the section's heading.
 *
 * Open is the shell's own interaction, so it may hold it (AGENTS.md rule 5): uncontrolled with
 * `defaultOpen`, controlled with `open`, and `onOpenChange` heard either way. The two never mirror.
